# static-comp-1

<p>
This is my first static comp challenge at Turing. I created this using CSS Grid and Flexbox.
</p>  
<p>
 Some things were a challenge such as getting the images and the text in the top buttons to align, among many other things.
</p>
<p>
Images/icons were found @ www.flaticon.com.
